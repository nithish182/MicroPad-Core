# Contribution Guide
Firstly, thanks for looking into contributing to micropad! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

## Step 1. Find something that needs doing
You can look on the two [GitHub Project boards](https://github.com/orgs/micropad/projects)
to find a task to pickup.

## Step 2. Get the code and do the task
Checkout the [readme](https://github.com/micropad/micropad-Core/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on getting the code running.  
You should branch from `next-dev` when making your changes.

## Step 3. Make the pull request
Create a pull request from your branch to `next-dev`. Your pull request will be reviewed and have the CI run on it.
If your request is accepted then your code will be merged into `next-dev`, which will then make it into `master` for the next release.

# Other information
- Please don't update the version number in your branch. It'll be updated in `next-dev` when a release is ready.
